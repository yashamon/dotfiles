useSemanticElements now ignores elements with the img role (#3994).

MDN recommends using role="img" for grouping images or creating an image from other elements.

CLI v1.9.2
CLI
New features
Added support for custom GritQL definitions, including:

Pattern and predicate definitions: https://docs.grit.io/guides/patterns
Function definitions: https://docs.grit.io/language/functions#function-definitions
Contributed by @arendjr

Bug fixes
Fix #3917, where the fixed files were incorrectly computed. Contributed by @ematipico
Fixed an issue that caused GritQL contains queries to report false positives when the matched
node appeared inside a sibling node. Contributed by @arendjr
Editors
Bug fixes
Fix #3923. Now the .editorconfig is correctly parsed by the LSP, and the options are correctly applied to files when formatting is triggered.
Plus, the Biome LSP now watches for any change to the .editorconfig, and updates the formatting settings.

Reduced the number of log files generated by the LSP server. Now the maximum number of logs saved on disk is seven. Contributed by @ematipico

Fix the code actions capabilities available in the LSP Biome server. Before, the LSP was using the default capabilities, which resulted in pulling code actions even when they were disabled by the editor.

This means that the code actions are pulled by the client only when the editor enables quickfix.biome, source.organizeImports.biome and source.fixAll.biome.

Now, if you enable organizeImports.enabled: true in the biome.json, and then you configure your editor with the following code action source.organizeImports.biome: false, the editor won't sort the imports.

Implement the semantic model for CSS. Contributed by @togami2864
CLI
New features
Add --graphql-linter-enabled option, to control whether the linter should be enabled or not for GraphQL files. Contributed by @ematipico

New EXPERIMENTAL search command. The search command allows you to search a Biome project using GritQL syntax.

GritQL is a powerful language that lets you do structural searches on your codebase. This means that trivia such as whitespace or even the type of strings quotes used will be ignored in your search query. It also has many features for querying the structure of your code, making it much more elegant for searching code than regular expressions.

While we believe this command may already be useful to users in some situations (especially when integrated in the IDE extensions!), we also had an ulterior motive for adding this command: We intend to utilize GritQL for our plugin efforts, and by allowing our users to try it out in a first iteration, we hope to gain insight in the type of queries you want to do, as well as the bugs we need to focus on.

For now, the search command is explicitly marked as EXPERIMENTAL, since many bugs remain. Keep this in mind when you try it out, and please let us know your issues!

Note: GritQL escapes code snippets using backticks, but most shells interpret backticks as command invocations. To avoid this, it's best to put single quotes around your Grit queries.

																																																															echo "let x = 1" | biome lint --stdin-file-path=stdin.js

																																																															Configuration
																																																															Add support for loading configuration from .editorconfig files (#1724).

																																																															Configuration supplied in .editorconfig will be overridden by the configuration in biome.json. Support is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding the following to your formatter configuration in biome.json:

																																																															{
																																																																  "formatter": {
																																																																	    "useEditorconfig": true
																																																																		  }
																																																																		}
																																																																		Contributed by @dyc3

																																																																		overrides from an extended configuration is now merged with the overrides of the extension.

																																																																		Given the following shared configuration biome.shared.json:

																																																																		{
																																																																			  "overrides": [
																																																																				    {
																																																																						      "include": ["**/*.json"],
																																																																							      // ...
																																																																								    }
																																																																									  ]
																																																																									}
																																																																									and the following configuration:

																																																																									{
																																																																										  "extends": ["./biome.shared.json"],
																																																																										  "overrides": [
																																																																											    {
																																																																													      "include": ["**/*.ts"],
																																																																														      // ...
																																																																															    }
																																																																																  ]
																																																																																}
																																																																																Previously, the overrides from biome.shared.json was overwritten.
																																																																																It is now merged and results in the following configuration:

																																																																																{
																																																																																	  "extends": ["./biome.shared.json"],
																																																																																	  "overrides": [
																																																																																		    {
																																																																																				      "include": ["**/*.json"],
																																																																																					      // ...
																																																																																						    },
																																																																																							    {

																																																																																																														useFilenamingConvention now supports unicase letters.

																																																																																																														unicase letters have a single case: they are neither uppercase nor lowercase.
																																																																																																														Biome now accepts filenames in unicase.
																																																																																																														For example, the filename 안녕하세요 is now accepted.

																																																																																																														We still reject a name that mixes unicase characters with lowercase or uppercase characters.
																																																																																																														For example, the filename A안녕하세요 is rejected.

																																																																																																														This change also fixes #3353.
																																																																																																														Filenames consisting only of numbers are now accepted.

																																																																																																														Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																														useFilenamingConvention now supports Next.js/Nuxt/Astro dynamic routes (#3465).

																																																																																																														Next.js, SolidStart, Nuxt, and Astro support dynamic routes such as [...slug].js and [[...slug]].js.

																																																																																																														Biome now recognizes this syntax. slug must contain only alphanumeric characters.

																																																																																																														Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																														useExportType no longer report empty export (#3535).

																																																																																																														An empty export {} allows you to force TypeScript to consider a file with no imports and exports as an EcmaScript module.
																																																																																																														While export type {} is valid, it is more common to use export {}.
																																																																																																														Users may find it confusing that the linter asks them to convert it to export type {}.
																																																																																																														Also, a bundler should be able to remove export {} as well as export type {}.
																																																																																																														So it is not so useful to report export {}.

																																																																																																														Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																														noUnusedVariables now checks TypeScript declaration files.

																																																																																																														This allows to report a type that is unused because it isn't exported.
																																																																																																														Global declarations files (declarations files without exports and imports) are still ignored.

																																																																																																														useAdjacentOverloadSignatures no longer reports a #private class member and a public class member that share the same name (#3309).

																																																																																																														The following code is no longer reported:

																																																																																																															  #f() {}
																																																																																																															  g() {}
																																																																																																															  f() {}
																																																																																																															}
																																																																																																															Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																															useNamingConvention now accepts applying custom convention on abstract classes. Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																															useNamingConvention no longer suggests an empty fix when a name doesn't match strict Pascal case (#3561).

																																																																																																															Previously the following code led useNamingConvention to suggest an empty fix.
																																																																																																															The rule no longer provides a fix for this case.

																																																																																																															type AAb = any
																																																																																																															Contributed by @Conaclos

																																																																																																															useNamingConvention no longer provides fixes for global TypeScript declaration files.

																																																																																																															Global TypeScript declaration files have no epxorts and no imports.
																																																																																																															All the declared types are available in all files of the project.
																																																																																																															Thus, it is not safe to propose renaming only in the declaration file.

																																																																																																																			Enhancements
																																																																																																																			Enhance tailwind sorting lint rule #1274 with variant support.
																																																																																																																			
																																																																																																																			Every preconfigured variant is assigned a weight that concurs on establishing the output sorting order.
																																																																																																																			Since nesting variants on the same utility class is possible, the resulting weight is the Bitwise XOR of all the variants weight for that class.
																																																																																																																			Dynamic variants (e.g. has-[.custom-class], group-[:checked]) are also supported and they take the weight of their base variant name the custom value attached (e.g. has-[.custom-class] takes has weight).
																																																																																																																			Arbitrary variants (e.g. [&nth-child(2)]) don't have a weight assigned and they are placed after every known variant.
																																																																																																																			Classes with the same amount of arbitrary variants follow lexicographical order. The class that has the highest number of nested arbitrary variants is placed last.
																																																																																																																			Screen variants (e.g. sm:, max-md:, min-lg:) are not supported yet.
