- stop downloading! ( endgame ) if we have downloaded and hashchecked all pieces
- adjust allowed per torrent memory cache
- add queue function, set default to 1 for low ram devices.
- if piece sizes are quite small (64KB!!! WTF) need to coalesce

- clicking on update message should launch app
- createObjectURL / revoke not letting background page go inactive. file bug
- show "loading..." for files pane (can take a while to initialize file objects)
- check external storage detaching handling workin ... 
- diskio so messy. checkShouldBail? what a mess. redo everything
- secretly play mp4 in background to get range request, or parse mp4 box headers and dl that right away
- stopping other torrents gets disk queue broken in getMetadata state? (shouldbail?)
- search opensubtitles on file (right click?)
- filewriter already has file size/length (so dont need to get metadata)
- with diskio problems of any type, clear all cache and retry
- problem with entryCache entry.filesystem name being chrome-extension_.... vs retainstr(disk.key)
- add button sometimes didnt select torrent / start torrent
- seeding, not clearing pieces out of cache!
- store graph of download progress for debugging (bytes/s, # conns, etc)
- lazy load disks and dont show notification if torrent not active/loaded
- check for lastError in torrent metadata save. (FILE_ERROR_NO_SPACE)
- saving large file to google drive gives hard disk full notification.
- web server leaving ports open ? after many ctrl-r it runs out of retries on listen
- right click to remove tracker
- closing choked connections needs to account not for whole swarm size, but actually valid swarm size
- bridges when no incomplete pieces after seek area, remove bridges. also when long delay temp. turn on endgame?
- show ETA in progress bar notification
- when window is minimized, show app status in a notification
- store .torrent files in local sandbox persistent storage (option)
- store total bytes received in swarm list, and persist it for a while? (resume)
- poll navigator.onLine sometimes ... ?
- register idle change when app is open / foreground, so we can handle sleep/resume better
- send keepalives or at least newstate think to sockets (sleep mode and they can stay connected?)
- move calculate_speed into timer independent from UI render
- store bitfield as binary string in local storage
- show notification when update available, or when update was installed.
- small swarm debugging
- run overnight, look for memory leak/crash on low memory system

2.1 fixes
- recalculateblacklist serially, bad
- onupdated background page reload error?
- highlight effect is jarring/red
- drag and drop .torrent file in windows, or maybe button to add torrent file

- see what happens when add invalid .torrent file

new stuff to add
- SOCKS5 support
- add version numbers in the app


- need to disconnect from peers when no message received in n seconds (i.e. if computer goes to sleep...)
- add "delete torrent and files" to more actions
- fix file getting to > 100% (downloaded being incremented twice somehow)
- better handling when disconnecting external storage (display better error)
- pNaCL sha1 hashing of pieces
