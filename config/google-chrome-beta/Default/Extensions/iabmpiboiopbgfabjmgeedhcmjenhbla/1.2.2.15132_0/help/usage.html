                        or key combinations you <i>do</i> have but that you find are being interpreted by your Chrome-enabled device, for example Ctrl+Alt+Delete.<br/><br/>
						Note that modifier keys such as Ctrl are dark gray. Clicking once turns the key blue to indicate that it is being held down ready to modify the next key press only.<br/><br/>
						The Windows (or Super) key appears twice: once as a modifier and once as a single-press key. Click the former to perform a shortcut on the remote computer, for example Windows+D to show the desktop under Windows. Click the latter to open the <b>Start</b> menu on a remote Windows computer.</td>
