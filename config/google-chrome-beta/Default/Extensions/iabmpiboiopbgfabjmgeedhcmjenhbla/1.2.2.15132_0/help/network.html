    <p>If you are connecting over the Internet, the remote computer is very likely to be protected by at least one firewall and router. If this is the case, you must:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Configure its firewall to allow network communications through to a particular port (5900 by default).</li>
		<li>Configure its router to forward network communications through to the same port. We recommend you assign a static IP address to the remote computer, for example <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</li>
		<li>Obtain its <a href="address-public.html">public network address</a>, which is that of the router, and use this to connect. We recommend that if your ISP changes your router's address periodically, you apply for a host name (using a service such as www.noip.com).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For more information on these operations, please read the <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/chrome/latest/" target="_blank">online guide</a>.</p>
