# Module descriptions - util

## aceLoad.js

Shims Ace's loadScript() async loader so that AMD modules can simply declare Ace dependencies the same way they declare AMD dependencies.

## dom2.js

Instead of using an MVC framework like Backbone or a view binding library like
Angular, Caret modifies the DOM prototypes to have a more jQuery-like UI with
this module. Since Chrome apps cannot share a page with external scripts, and
since we know that the Chrome DOM prototypes are stable, this is a safe and
easy way to get sensible DOM manipulation. Exposes no methods or data, but
does modify the Document, DocumentFragment, Element, and Window prototypes.

## inflate.js

Chrome OS disallows using `eval()` or `new Function()`, which means many
template libraries simply won't work without pre-compiling the templates.
Instead of going that route, recognizing that template speed is almost never a
bottleneck for Caret, inflate.js provides Mustache-compatible templating that
can load from the filesystem or the DOM (loaded automatically by ID). Exposes
the following methods:

- `load`- Pulls a template from the given filesystem path. Returns a promise that resolves when the template is ready.
- `loadHTML` - Directly insert HTML into the template cache for use.
- `get` - Fills a template with data and returns a DOM element.
- `getHTML` - Fills a template with data and returns the string representation
- `getAsync` - Used to simultaneously load and fill a template. Returns a promise that resolves with the filled template as a DOM element.

## manos.js

A lightweight library for handling async code, this serves as the "hands of
fate" for your callbacks. Provides `serial()` and `map()` for async array
manipulation, and `pton()` and `deferred` for working with native ES6
Promises.

## template.js

A plugin that loads a template from disk, then returns the `inflate` templating
object. Useful for modules that need a template as part of their dependencies.

## text.js

A RequireJS plugin that loads files from Caret's app directory using XHR. Used
to get the default settings JSON through a standard interface.
