# Module descriptions - storage/*

## file.js

Wraps the chrome.fileSystem APIs in a friendly File constructor. File objects
have the following methods or properties, most of which should be self
explanatory. Most methods return promises, but also accept node-style callbacks.

- `open`
- `read`
- `write`
- `stat`
- `retain`
- `restore`
- `getPath`
- `entry` - contains the actual entry object.

All storage in Caret, regardless of its actual backing structure, goes through
objects adhering to the File interface, which makes it much easier to open
many types of data through the same tab/editor UI. It also makes persistence
much more consistent and less verbose throughout Caret.

## settingsProvider.js

The actual singleton returned when modules load configs via the `settings`
plugin. Provides the following API:

- `get` Retrieves the current settings object by name, with all layers `(project, local, and default) merged over top each other.
- `getAsString` Retrieves the local settings as a string, mostly used when opening settings for editing.
- `getAsFile`
- `load` Requests a fresh copy of the local settings from sync storage, usually called after either writing to settings or when the dependent module does not have a settings cache.
- `setProject` Sets the top-most JSON object to be merged when calling `Settings.get()`, used for the project-specific settings overrides.
- `clearProject` Removes the top-most JSON object, so that only local and default settings are merged.
- `pull` Calls load/get for you on the list of arguments, and returns a promise that's fullfilled with a hash of the requested settings.

## syncfile.js

A constructor matching the File interface, but backed by chrome.storage.sync.
Used to open settings "files."

## syncFS.js

An abstraction over top of chrome.storage.sync, capable of storing data larger
than the sync storage limit by splitting it into multiple entries behind the
scenes. Returns promises for all methods.
