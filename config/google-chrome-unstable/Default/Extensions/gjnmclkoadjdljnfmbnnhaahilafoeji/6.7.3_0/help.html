    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><b>TeX for Gmail</b> (TFG) allows one to use 
      <a target="_blank"
      href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">TeX</a>
      in emails, both for reading and writing. Any formulas enclosed
      into <span class="pattern">$...$, \(...\)</span>
	(for inline math) or
	 <span class="pattern">\[...\], $$...$$</span>
      (for displayed math) will be nicely typeset.

    <p>
      <font color=#cc0000> The formulas can be long but they must be
  unbroken, with no newlines between the $. Also, there shouldn't be
  any HTML in the formulas (you can use the button Remove Formatting
  to remove it).
      </font></p>
      
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>
This extension does not collect any information about the users. It
replaces mathematical formulas in the outgoing messages by links to
images created and controlled by Codecogs
<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php</a>
and Wordpress
<a href="https://wordpress.com">https://wordpress.com</a>.
    </p>

  <h2>Writing an email</h2>

    <p> You can click on the TeX button to access a menu, or you can
       use keyboard shortcuts.  You can hide the Compose TeX button in the
      Options; the shortcuts will still work.

      <img src="compose1s.png" class="img" style="margin:auto; width:76.4%">
    </p>

  <p><font color=#cc0000> When you are composing a message, make sure
      you are NOT in "Plain text mode"!
  </p></font>

  <!--
    <p><font color=#cc0000> If TFG ever becomes non-responsive, the
    easiest is to reload the Gmail web page.  That
    should update the extension to the latest installed version. As
    the last resort, try clearing the cache.
    </font>
    </p>
    -->
    
  <h2>Reading an email</h2>

    <p>You can use either the TeX button or (in Gmail only) the drop
    down "More" menu for the message you are viewing. Both of these
    can be hidden or revealed in the Options. 
      </p>

  <img src="view1s.png" class="img" style="margin:auto; float:left; width:45.6%">
  <img src="view2s.png" class="img" style="margin:auto; float:right; width:51.3%">

  <p style="clear:both"></p>


  
  <h2>Rich math</h2>

  <p>When <strong>Rich math</strong> is selected, TFG searches for
  patterns <span class="pattern">$...$, $$...$$, \(...\),
  \[...\]</span> and replaces <span class="pattern">...</span> with
  images (as web links) created and hosted by an outside server,
  Codecogs or WordPress, configurable in the Options.
  </p>

  <font color=#cc0000>
    <p>
	NOTE: When a server is down new images are temporarily not
	  created. For Codecogs, you can check the current status by
	  going directly to 
    <a target="_blank"
       href="https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">Codecogs</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can switch the image server in the Options. WordPress is much
      more reliable than Codecogs, but Codecogs can handle more complicated
      formulas and environments. The formulas with matrices now
      automatically use Codecogs since WordPress does not render them.
    </p>
      </font>

    
    <p>
      By default, images are created at the 300% magnification and
      then downsized. Usually this leads to crisper images
      but on some displays images may appear fuzzy. You can switch
      to the 100% magnification in the Options.
    </p>
    
      
  <h2>Simple math</h2>

  <p>When <strong>Simple math</strong> is selected, TFG searches for patterns
  <span class="pattern">$...$, $$...$$, \(...\), \[...\]</span> and
  replaces <span class="pattern">...</span> with HTML, which can
  handle quite a lot on its own (for example:
  '&amp;beta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;' gives &beta;<sup>2</sup>).  The
  resulting formulas do not need any outside image servers and work
  offline. You can customize the font
  in Options using any legal CSS,
  separately for outgoing and incoming messages.
  </p>

  <p>Note:
  your addressee may not have the fonts that are installed on your
  computer, such as STIX or Cambria Math, so they may see your message
  differently. For this reason you may want to stick to
  <i>font-style:italic</i> for the outgoing messages when using Simple math.
  </p>

  <h2>Guess naive TeX</h2>

  <p>Mathematicians frequently write math in email using intuitive
  naive TeX, e.g.:
  <span class="pattern">x^10</span>, not necessarily following
  formal TeX rules and without bothering to enclose it into
  $...$. This option searches for such patterns and tries to typeset
  them with HTML using a best guess.
  </p>

  <h2>Abbreviations</h2>

  <p>TFG knows many common abbreviations such as
  <ul>
    <li><strong>\bA</strong> &rarr; \mathbb A, 
    <li><strong>\bfA</strong> or <strong>\dA</strong> &rarr; \mathbf A,
    <li><strong>\cA</strong> &rarr; \mathcal A,
    <li><strong>\fA</strong> &rarr; \mathfrak A,
    <li><strong>\wA</strong> &rarr; \widetilde A,
    <li><strong>\oA</strong> &rarr; \overline A,
    <li><strong>\uA</strong> &rarr; \underline A.
  </ul>
  So you are free to use them. Support for custom macros may be added
  in a future version.
  </p>

  <h2>Undoing your work</h2>

  <p>You typeset your formula into a nice image and you see that it is
  a little wrong. How do you go back? Well, you can always use the
  built-in undo, which is usually Control-Z or Command-Z. You can also click
  on the image and TFG will offer to change it back into TeX. 
  
  <h2>Theorem-like environments</h2>

  <p>\begin{theorem}The equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ has no solutions in positive integers $x,y,z,n$ with $n\ge3$. \end{}</p>

    <p>produces

    <div style="width=200px; margin: 5px 0.15em; border: 1px solid rgb(234, 234,
    234); border-radius: 5px; padding: 0.5em 0.7em; display: block;
    background:#ffffe0; border:1px solid #ffd700;
    "><strong>Theorem. </strong>The equation 
	<span style="font-style:
    italic">x<sup>n</sup>+y<sup>n</sup>=z<sup>n</sup></span> has no 
    solutions in positive
    integers <span style="font-style:italic">x,y,z,n</span>
    with <span style="font-style:italic">n &ge; 3</span>.</div>

  </p>

  <p>Note that '\begin{theorem}...\end{}' should <strong>not</strong> be enclosed in
$$...$$. On the other hand, the usual math environments such as matrix,
pmatrix, bmatrix, etc. still work in Rich Math mode if they are
properly enclosed in $$...$$.

There is an optional argument for the theme: red, blue, green,
  gray, yellow (default). For example, \begin{theorem}{green}
... \end{}.
  </p>

  <h2>Other tips</h2>

  <p>Do not end a formula with a blank space when using single $'s.
    For example, <span class="pattern">$x^2 $</span> will not TeX. This is
    done to avoid accidentally texing sentences like <i>Bread is $1 and milk is $2.</i>
  </p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>
      If TFG does not seem to be working, try the following steps:
      <ul>
	<li>Are you using Stay Focusd extension or some other
	extension blocking certain web sites? Well, obviously you need to
	unblock www.codecogs.com and s0.wp.com.
	<li>Reload the Gmail page. Has it started working?
	<li>Clear the cache: Go to Chrome menu &rarr; More Tools
	&rarr; Clear Browsing Data &rarr; check <i>"Cached images and
	files"</i> &rarr; click on <i>"Clear Browsing Data"</i>. Now
	reload the Gmail page. Has it started working?
	<li>If those steps failed to fix TFG,
	  <a href="mailto:va.email.tex@gmail.com">email the developer</a>.
      </ul>
