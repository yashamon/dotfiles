The rakoans enjoy the beauty of their many colors, the skywhales the tasty meal they provide, and the yaks the softness of their tangles when looking for a place to rest. The invading Empire did not find the anemones so delightful, as they often would get stuck in the turbines of their airships and grasp distracted drakeriders in the midst of battle.

CARD_0314_BODY;If you ever wander where wood and fire meet, beware the roars of the Crackthorn.

Then I ran again. And again. And again. Only once did I fear for my life, but that fear has never left me, for still the beast hunts. Still I am it’s prey.
CARD_0199_BODY;Devils live at the edge of the world, where their homeland is left scorched and barren by the burning eye of Ouroborus. The weakest scavenge whatever they can, while the strong eat anything weaker than themselves. The exception is the Hate Seed.

CARD_0048_BODY;The elders of Syland have lived long, hard lives that often leave them feeble but wise. They do their best to pass this wisdom on to the younger generations, even as the wide-eyed youths dream of great adventure while trying to avoid the practical and necessary toiling in the fields.
CARD_0044_BODY;Sylanders often go hungry due to frequent and merciless raids from the barbarian clans. As they watch their fields being plundered and burned from behind stone walls, they know that another hard winter is ahead of them.

CARD_0014_BODY;When Sharra was badly injured by Tethra, her Master took her to a hidden monastery and played a mystic song for her every day until she was completely healed.

CARD_0671_BODY;Thunder Eels are extremely rare, born only when the immense power of a lightning strike charges one of their floating eggs.  Primitive rakoans have been known to think that the eels are storm gods, and shower them with worship and gifts of precious metals.
CARD_0670_BODY;Rakoans would often plant growths from the Tree of Everlife and build shrines around them where they could leave offerings. Benevolent spirits of bounty and growth would often take residence in the shrines, providing assistance to the neighboring rakoans. When Everlife fell the trees withered away to dead husks. Now dark spirits dwell within, delighting in their torment of the rakoans that once sought blessings at the shrines.
CARD_0669_BODY;There are many ways to profit from war. Some sell weapons to both sides, others are coaxed to betrayal through generous bribes, while others scavenge the battlefield for anything that sparkles or gleams. Birds care not for such wealth though, but find profit enough in the meat and viscera swollen under the blood tinged radiance of Ouroboros’ eye.
CARD_0668_BODY;As corruption spread across Oversky, it affected first the many varied plants and animals. But as the darkness grew, it began to go deeper, twisting the very spirits of the land. Where once an elemental was content to protect its patch of sandy soil, it now had no other desire but to sap the life from all it sees and turn fertile valleys into dust choked deserts.
CARD_0667_BODY;Just as primal spirits of life are born from the blossoming of a flower, or the first breath of a infant, dark spirits emerge enmass in the wake of death, disease, and destruction. One of the foulest of these spirits is the blightborne spectre. It slithers into existence with the last rattling breath of someone who died with great suffering, and upon stealing the visage of the dead, it goes on to cause more suffering in their name.
CARD_0666_BODY;At first we thought it was the shadow and buzz of Imperial airships coming back to finish the job. But then one of my companions cried out in warning as a giant misshapen insect descended from the sky. We all ran, as fast as we could, but I was faster than most. When we returned hours later we found the corpses of the ones we had lost bloated with eggs. It took only a moment of watching the larva squirming in those eggs before we burned everybody we could find.
CARD_0665_BODY;War took its toll on the once bountiful isles of Oversky, leaving large swathes of barren and devastated land occupied by the Emperor’s armies. While many wild creatures were left struggling to survive, some vermin actually thrived under these conditions. Far happier to feast on the refuse of Imperial soldiers than scavenge in predator filled wilderness.
CARD_0664_BODY;Every spark, every ember, has a hunger you must remember\nKeep it close, and hold it tight, or else it will burn you bright\nFeed it only bits and bobs, never give it fields and logs\nOne fire is all it takes, before you find yourself charred to steaks
CARD_0663_BODY;Since times immemorial there have been mortals that bow down to any great power, even if it means their own destruction. Those who venerate Ignus are among the most self-destructive, willing to set the world to flame in order to bring glory to their master. They flock to the banner of the Emperor, believing his war will leave nothing but fire and ash in its wake.
CARD_0662_BODY;At the moment of Ignus’ birth there was nothing but the burning glory of endless flame. It is all the great elemental wishes to return to, even if it must bring the whole world burning down around it, one spark at a time.
CARD_0661_BODY;The kobolds delighted in the war taking place far away from their Empire and did everything possible to fan the flames of conflict. A favored trick was to smuggle demons into the camps of both sides, causing death and mayhem with nothing but a few well placed barrels.
CARD_0660_BODY;Everyone knows of the great war between the Empire and the natives of Oversky. An epic conflict of machine vs. nature. Few on the other hand know of the struggle between Ro88E and the mangy bear that lives in that cave by the river. But that makes it no less important for those involved.
CARD_0659_BODY;During the war, the rakoans would pack these hippos with faeria infused grains and send them running into the enemy ranks. The faeria made them quite volatile, and they would release powerful bursts of energy as they trampled through the Imperial soldiers.
CARD_0658_BODY;It emerged from the clouds, the light of Ouroboros gleaming across its bow as we all looked up in awe. Then there was a crack of thunder and a thousand rockets descended upon us. I tried to run, to hide, to do anything to save myself from the wave after wave of bombardment. I don’t know how I survived, but when I awoke and pulled myself from the rubble I was all that remained of my village. – Proudtail, Rakoan Farmer
CARD_0657_BODY;Crewed by the most daring and charming crew in the 12 Skies, the Gagana has had more adventures than a Syland farm boy could ever dream, seen wonders that Orosei wouldn’t believe, and collected treasures that the Emperor himself would marvel at. They are willing to put all that behind them though for the greatest adventure of all. Saving the world.
CARD_0656_BODY;The Imperial Navy had amassed aerial armaments for years in preparation for war. Now that they were finally given the chance to use them they were quite liberal in their application, often using 100 rockets where 1 would do.
CARD_0655_BODY;The Empire was quick to build outposts across Oversky. They served the dual purpose of subjugating the populous and extracting faeria from the land to fuel the Emperor’s many warmachines.
CARD_0654_BODY;The Obsidian Skywhales are the great predators of the heavens, using storm clouds to obscure their approach as they hunt the largest of Oversky’s many flying creatures. Shozen was the name given to the cruelest of the Obsidian Skywhales, whose hunger drove it to turn on its own kind, hunting and consuming them one by one. The corruption of Oversky has not made Shozen’s disposition any better.
CARD_0653_BODY;There is no place in Oversky that the Emperor’s corruption did not touch, no place so sacred or pure that it was spared. Forests became blights, towns turned into ruins, and places of blessings were twisted into monuments to curses.
CARD_0652_BODY;Twelve priests tended the Temple of Everlife during day, and twelve during night. All twenty and four stood in opposition of the Emperor when he took the tree. Sixteen were slain as an example to those who resisted. Three escaped to warn others of the sacrilege that took place. Two joined willingly with the Emperor and were given places of honor within his court. The last three were bound in chains and magic, their will no longer their own.
CARD_0258_BODY;The oradrim knights of the Djidan Order can use the faintest breeze to travel almost anywhere with the speed of thought. Less gifted oradrim require the use of the wind gates to channel their latent powers to move around the desert.
CARD_0517_BODY;The lifecycle of the flash salmon is amazingly short. They hatch from their eggs in cool, fertile ground and wait there until their wings fully form. They then dart from the hot sands and take to the air, eating everything they can. They fly until they find another island, then burrow under the ground to lay their eggs and die.
CARD_0359_BODY;All things must come to an end, it is true. It is my belief though that those who follow the path of unrighteousness should find that end sooner than those who live lives of justice and harmony. - Khalim
CARD_0307_BODY;Traveling through a sandstorm is bad enough without the sand actively trying to force its way down your throat.
CARD_0265_BODY;The shaytan priests of Ouroboros gain great power in dark and terrible places. Each soul they feed to the Endless Serpent increases Its power while removing from the world a bit of the faeria that protects all of creation.
CARD_0240_BODY;At the edge of the world under the heat of Ouroboros’ Eye, faeria boils and congeals into a hard substance called bloodstone. Some sprites feed on this red, essence-infused rock, turning into twisted and hateful things that delight in the pain of others.
CARD_0094_BODY;The essence of dreams can craft anything that can be imagined. Object or person, living or dead, it does not matter as long as someone remembers its existence in the deep imaginings of their slumber.
CARD_0073_BODY;Each crashing wave contains a drop of faeria. Every tide flows with its glorious essence, and every ebb and sway of the ocean swells with its power. This is our inheritance from the sea. Woe to any enemy that forces us to use what we have been given cycle after cycle.
CARD_0127_BODY;Emperor Kaios performed many experiments in his pursuit of godhood. While none gave him the ultimate results he was hoping for, he still learned much in their failure.
CARD_0042_BODY;The faeria-fueled siege engines of the Mîrnast Empire are some of the most destructive weapons in existence. Given enough time, a single engine can reduce any fortress to dust and rubble.

CARD_0673_BODY;Once the most loyal and dutiful servant of the Emperor, Banon came to realize that Kaios had gone too far down the mad path of power to be saved. Though Banon now stands against his friend and lover, he loves him no less than the day he swore his oath and heart to him.
CARD_0248_BODY;In a desperate attempt to stop Seifer and his armies, the Lords of Terror sacrificed many of their own to summon a giant orb of flame and stone. When the dust and embers cleared, Seifer still lived with much of his army. He made short work of the weakened devil forces, driving the Lords of Terror into shame and exile.
CARD_0679_BODY;There was once a triton lord so gluttonous and wealthy that he ordered a hundred dishes each cooked by a hundred chefs and fed to him by a hundred servants. He ate, and he ate, until every dish was gone. When he called on the servants to bring him more, however, he found that they were all gone.
CARD_0692_BODY;Everyone sees the big and strong. They worship, serve, or fear them. No one pays attention to you, though. They hunt and hurt you. Come, little one. Let me hold you and keep you safe until I grow you strong enough that you can protect yourself.
CARD_0691_BODY;There is no greater joy than that of a righteous war well-fought and won. All the pain, the sorrow, and the hardship serve to bring the celebration to heights as impossible as the victory itself.
CARD_0690_BODY;At the eve of battle, the winds whispered his coming. The air trembled with his might. Dwordia, the first Chieftain, rode from the Distant Isles to bring vengeance upon the abomination that had defiled the lands he had sworn to protect in life. When the deed was done and Kaois was slain, he vanished once more with a breeze, content to return to his rest once more.
CARD_0689_BODY;Rarely seen but often felt, the Zephyrs are born from the last breath of an innocent soul and tasked to watch over them. They carry their ward to the Distant Isles and then run errands for them in the living realms, gathering gossip or snatching up their favorite foods.
CARD_0688_BODY;Despite the devastation left by the war, the land was quick to be regrown. Nurtured in life and fertilized in death, overgrown forests soon covered the Oversky thanks to the zealous work of these fertile tree spirits.
CARD_0687_BODY;While many of the priests were killed when the Overmind took the Tree, a handful escaped to warn others of his atrocities. They roamed Oversky tirelessly, rallying every person and wild thing to the protection of their communal home.
CARD_0686_BODY;We answer your call. The smoke of your anguish. The ashes of your pain. The cries of your twisting timber and cracking limbs. We answer your call. All the strength of Erianor comes as one.

CARD_0684_BODY;Unable to as easily spread themselves as their aquatic cousins, the coral of Oversky depends on these graceful beasts to carry them from isle to isle. In exchange, the coral stores faeria within its intricate living structures, imbuing the creature with power it can use to protect itself and its charge.
CARD_0683_BODY;While the gabrians were not able to lend much aid to the war raging far above their ocean home, they provided plenty of assistance in throwing the victory party.
CARD_0682_BODY;The Tide Lord's blessing be upon you, my friend. His waves will carry you to warm waters, his trident will protect you, and the tides under his command will bring you tasty fish all the days of your life.
CARD_0681_BODY;It took more than strength of arms to defeat Kaios and his forces. While many races lent their weapons and expertise to the task, it was the triton tacticians that planned the final battle and won the day.
CARD_0680_BODY;In every mirror I've looked before, I've seen only my reflection. But in these I've found that it was them seeing their own reflection in me.
CARD_0678_BODY;The rakoa used to find herds of yaks stranded on tiny islands devoid of grass and water. While some may call their solution to the problem utterly mad, the yaks themselves find it quite adequate as long as they have enough space for a running leap.
CARD_0677_BODY;Where did Hosa get to now?!
CARD_0676_BODY;Hosa was a wild yak, who liked to run away. Even though the shepherd tried, there was nothing they could do or say. Hosa would be calm and good, until they looked away. Then he would run far and wide, just to get all of that tasty hay.
CARD_0675_BODY;The Llamacorn is the subject of many myths and superstitions. It is said that a jacket made of its wool will make you irresistible to others. Its ground up horn will purify the most foul of waters. Its dung makes an excellent additive to the best of beers. It is a wonder that the whole species isn't rounded up into farms or hunted to extinction by now.
CARD_0674_BODY;It is over, Kaios. I stood aside once before, but never again will I yield to the likes of you!
CARD_0529_BODY;The isles of Oversky drift according to the ebbs and flows of the skytides. Because this is very inconvenient for anyone living on these islands, Towships are invariably a booming business.

CARD_0510_BODY;When Kaios first arrived in Oversky, the rakoa greeted him with a bounty of gifts to honor the friendship that could exist between them. Kaios only saw such gifts as weakness, and the rakoa fit for nothing more than tribute.

CARD_0503_BODY;No one knows why someone thought it was a good idea to create a contraption designed to throw yaks at people. Regardless, it turned out to be a pretty effective method of persuading enemies to leave you alone. No one likes getting hit by a flying yak.
CARD_0372_BODY;Iona's frown can cripple a man. Her laughter can ignite a funeral into a celebration. As for her smile...creatures from distant lands will travel a thousand leagues just to bear witness.
CARD_0371_BODY;It is well known that Krog will eat anything...except yaks. He tried one once, but the wool tickled the back of his throat. Now he just keeps yaks around because he thinks they must be funny since the one he ate made him laugh.
CARD_0370_BODY;They appear from nowhere and strike you down before you even have a chance to blink. At best, all you can hope to do is draw a bit of their blood in the struggle. You must kill them as they kill you.

CARD_0368_BODY;The commands of the Emperor come in scrolls of black vellum, tied with a purple silk ribbon. The command is written in his own hand in gold ink, his seal pressed into crimson wax. Though no magic binds the subject of the command, only the greatest enemies of the Emperor would ever dare to disobey.
CARD_0358_BODY;Close to the edge of the world, the fires of Ouroboros' eye do not fall evenly on the land. Those who catch the attention of the Burning Eye suffer greatly, but those who learn how to direct its attention can lay waste to their enemies.
CARD_0355_BODY;When the tree that a kodama is bound to dies, usually the kodama wastes away soon after. A rare few, however, will become wild and hungry things, focused only on the destruction of those who harm the forest.
CARD_0354_BODY;While these creatures usually eat dreams, it is not difficult for them to consume the occasional god. For what are gods but imagination fused with purpose, possibility mixed with execution, dreams given form.
CARD_0319_BODY;When the first king of Meroval, Himsaël, came back from his expedition around the known world, he founded the famous royal academy of explorers, settlers, and cartographers. To this day they still create the most detailed maps in the world.

CARD_0298_BODY;You cannot see them in the night. During the day, they hide in your shadow. The deadliest things are not large and fierce. The deadliest things are in the quiet.
CARD_0294_BODY;Before Ouroboros awoke and attempted to swallow the world, the giants of wind would keep every sort of bird within these golden aviaries. Though much faded, the magic of these places still remains.
CARD_0293_BODY;If you wish the aid of the wind, you have to embrace its impulsive nature. To be the friend of the wind, you must first be a friend to it. - Khalim
CARD_0290_BODY;The faeries are tiny but powerful spirits who would follow the four elemental gods wherever they went. Without the light of their god to follow, the sunsilks wandered without purpose until the solars gathered them into their cities. This gave them a new purpose and a new home.
CARD_0278_BODY;Only the keldrans are able to train and ride the Dune Drakes, and even amongst them a master drake rider is highly respected. They are the elite of keldrans, deadly mercenaries that are paid a fortune by the richest Amai Trade Princes.
CARD_0257_BODY;A true master of the wind never walks.
CARD_0255_BODY;In any battle against a corrupt god, it is the sagittarius who strike first. While letting loose a storm of arrows to soften up the opposition, they inspire their allies to fight their hardest against those that would misuse the sacred essence of the world.
CARD_0246_BODY;These crumbling relics used to be among the deadliest weapons deployed during the War of Giants. While they are perpetually on the verge of becoming lifeless piles of stone, many have somehow outlasted the giants that made them.
CARD_0244_BODY;How could they let Aoros die? How can mortals still pray the other Gods? Astar was weak, Alua did nothing, Gaea only cared for her precious trees... And now they are laughing? How can they cheer and feast while the greatest of the Gods is dead?! They will pay for their lack of respect! - Garudan.
CARD_0237_BODY;Rumble and trouble. Quake and break. Praise to the thunderwalker, the boomstep, the groundshaker.

CARD_0226_BODY;These mecha are unusually excitable. While quite able to concentrate their flames into a focused beam, they often spray their fire everywhere at the first moment of ignition. What was supposed to be a nice cooking fire or a welded pipe can end up with half the town being burnt down.
CARD_0224_BODY;The mechas use a system of high-speed railcars to transfer goods and weapons between the principal cities within their lands. In more remote areas, or during one of their frequent invasions, they must rely on strong carrier mechas to bring in armaments and munitions.
CARD_0223_BODY;For creatures crafted with such meticulous care, every gear and piston a testament to perfect craftsmanship, mechas sure enjoy destroying things.
CARD_0196_BODY;During the height of their Empire, the kobolds built impregnable fortresses that spread out through tunnels, vaults, and caverns across the entire world. Their walls and gates would have never fallen by outside force, but were easily brought to ruin by internal strife and rebellion.
CARD_0181_BODY;In the center of the world lays the magical Valsîrion. Here the gods forged the world from mighty vortexes of elemental energy. Anything can be crafted or transformed here with a strong will and plenty of faeria to fuel the forges of creation.
CARD_0180_BODY;The mysterious weeping idols can be found throughout the rainforests around the Gaea Tree. While there are many tales and legends about where they come from, only a few know the truth: They were the children of Gaea who turned to stone when the goddess sacrificed herself. Now they weep not only for her death, but for the loss of every living thing.
CARD_0176_BODY;While all tikis worship sacred animals and honor Ruunin especially, a select few have sworn themselves fully to her cause of defending the woodlands. They ride on the backs of blessed wolves, scouting the borders of the wild, warning the Green Alliance of any threat they find.
CARD_0171_BODY;The faeries are tiny but powerful spirits who would follow the four elemental gods wherever they went. Without Gaea to guide them, the flowersilks live anywhere with large amounts of life essence. While this is most commonly areas with large and ancient trees, they have been known to trail after large beasts and even especially virile humans.
CARD_0157_BODY;Faeria exists all around, in every object and every living thing. However, like water, faeria also flows and collects into pools and lakes. And, like water, trees with hungry roots will suck up every drop and become holy bearers of divine energy to some, or living beacons of power and wealth to others.
CARD_0155_BODY;Ruunin has been the protector of the tiki tribes for thousands of years, but she can't be everywhere at once. In times of despair, the shamans gather around her shrines and call for her aid. They hope for her protection, but sometimes she can only offer her spirit.
CARD_0128_BODY;While it takes grandiose visions to sway the minds of the strong, those weak of will can be controlled with a daydream, a word, or even a simple trick.
CARD_0126_BODY;When the goddess of water Alua created the gabrians, she gave them the sacred task of shaping and caring for the ocean. The Wavecrafters took this duty very seriously, even going so far as to fuse their bodies with elementals of water to better control the waves and tides.
CARD_0117_BODY;In the lost temples of the ancient world, one can sometimes find strange, pulsating eggs. What might hatch from them, no one knows. Just in case it is a dragon or some evil monster, people tend to build their villages far from wherever these eggs might be found.

CARD_0110_BODY;The faeries are tiny but powerful spirits who would follow the four elemental gods wherever they went. The gemsilks used to wander aimlessly around lakes or over the oceans, but have recently begun to congregate above the waters of Gabria.
CARD_0106_BODY;... And then Alua ran right up the old snake's tail just as Ouroboros closed its jaws around her, swallowing both with a crash of light and thunder. That is how our great goddess tricked Ouroboros into swallowing its own tail so it couldn't finish eating the rest of the world. Now, now. Everybody to bed! Grandpa is tired.
CARD_0086_BODY;When you watch a triton chef working, you can have no doubt in your mind that they practice the pure art of cookery.  Roasting and preparing the giant fruits of the magical Puken'pin requires the highest level of mental fortitude and culinary skill, for lesser chefs cannot resist eating them before they are fully cooked.
CARD_0062_BODY;There is no more valuable resource in Mîrnast than faeria. Many young Mîrnasters risk everything to steal faeria from the dryads of the Sacred Forest. Few return, but those who do gain wealth and fame enough to inspire another generation to make the attempt.
CARD_0061_BODY;Anyone who opposed the status quo of the Mîrnast Empire was branded a criminal and cast out from the safety and luxury of the cities. Outlaws quickly become rebels, and rebels quickly earn a price upon their heads.
CARD_0054_BODY;In every age, there will always be men and women risking their youth and vigor for fame and fortune. Sadly, they often learn too late that bravery and daring is a poor substitute for wisdom and skill.
CARD_0045_BODY;In Meroval, King Magnus is said to mediate between feuding nobles while the royal judges handle justice for common citizens. However, insiders in the kingdom know that it is Queen Magda that manipulates both the high and low courts to her own ends.

CARD_0009_BODY;Since even before the days of the Empire, the Mîrnast academy of engineering has never stopped improving their faeria-fuelled machines and devices.
