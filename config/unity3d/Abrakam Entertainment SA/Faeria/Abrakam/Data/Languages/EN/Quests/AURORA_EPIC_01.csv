AURORA_EPIC_01_0001;You'd hurt an old woman?
AURORA_EPIC_01_0002;You need not do this...
AURORA_EPIC_01_0003;Your creature will be happier with me.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0004;Would you like some tea, dear?
AURORA_EPIC_01_0005;War is so noisy. Rest awhile.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0006;If you throw a green rock into a purple river, what happens?

AURORA_EPIC_01_0008;Such a lovely day.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0009;My tea is nearly finished.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0010;I've finished my tea.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0011;Thank you for letting me finish my tea.
AURORA_EPIC_01_0012;You shouldn't have let her finish her tea...
